# Recommendable by Daniel McGovern - A00249324 FYP


## Overview
This project is a web application built in conjunction with Spotify that generates recommendations for Spotify users based on their explicit feedback.

## Setup
1. Frontend Setup:
Open the main project folder in Visual Studio Code (or your preferred frontend code editor). In a terminal, navigate to 'web-api-auth/authorization_code' and use the command 'node app.js'.
The project should now be accessible on localhost:8888.

2. Backend Setup:
Open PyCharm (or your preferred Python IDE) and run the project. A statement confirming a successful connection to the remote database should be output.
The project should now be able to communicate effectively with the frontend.

Note: Full setup requires use of secret keys, which are not available on GitHub.
